          <h3> Created using ReactJS and ASP.NET</h3>
          <p>
            This is an application I worked on in my Software Engineering class with a group of 
            fellow students. Its an app that allows you to create a record of ingredients you currently
            have available and to use the list of ingredients to match to recipes that use them. The goal 
            is to help the user come up with recipe ideas that use the foods they have available
            so they are less likely to waste.
          </p>
          <p>My role in the project was to build the interface for the login page and logic behind
            user access to the website via a user token. I also created the browsing recipe page 
            that allows you to search recipes and see what ingredients you have available for them.

        <h3> Created using ReactJS</h3>
        <p>This game is a personal project of mine. Golf has been a card game I play a lot with my
          friends and was a project I wanted to start to learn more about using React. I have created
          the backend logic for the rules of the game and managing turns. I currently am working on
          creating the user interface and have the goal of setting up a virtual player so you can play
          the game even by yourself.
