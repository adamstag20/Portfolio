# Portfolio
This is a Personal Portfolio I put together for my Web Development class at Portland State Univeristy 2023. It is to showcase the skills I've learned
in the class with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I have an about me page, a projects section and a contact me page all accessible with a navigation bar.

To run the code please download the Portfolio folder.
Open the folder in a code editor of your choice.
Open the index.html file and click run.

Alternatively you can view the portfolio at ->

I used W3Schools.com to help me do most of the CSS styling.
