            <p>
                My name is Adam Stagner and I am currently majoring in Computer Science at 
                Portland State University with a graduation date of June 2023.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I work full time 
                as an IT Support Analyst for JAMS an alternative dispute resolution provider. I have 
                always enjoyed problem solving and working with tech. My current job allows me to work 
                with technology and has helped me grow in my management and communication skills through 
                helping lead the roll out of a new sales tool and interacting with clients and teams on a 
                daily basis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently looking to switch from the IT world to Software Engineering as 
                I enjoy the attention to detail involved with coding and designing/working with complex systems.
                My goal is to become a Full Stack Engineer because I love the UI design aspect but 
                also how the interactions with that interface are managed in the backend of different 
                applications.
